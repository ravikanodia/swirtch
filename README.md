swirtch is a demo of a pure JS search tool for Twitch.tv

Some of the CSS here is rougher than I'd like. Also, there's no whiff of a test suite to be found. On the flip side, it does some nifty tricks to replace the image previews with Twitch player embeds as a video preview.

TODO:
* infinite scroll
* re-use a single Twitch iframe instead of creating a new player for each search result card
